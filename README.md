# React + Vite + Vitest + React Testing Library + MSW Starter Template

This starter template is designed to provide a minimal setup for a React project using Vite. It includes Hot Module Replacement (HMR), Vitest for unit testing, React Testing Library for component testing, and Mock Service Worker (MSW) for seamless API testing. Additionally, it comes with a set of ESLint rules to ensure code quality.

The template utilizes two official plugins:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): This plugin uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to enable Fast Refresh, enhancing the development experience by allowing instant live updates without a full page refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): This plugin uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/), a super-fast JavaScript/TypeScript compiler, for Fast Refresh.

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
